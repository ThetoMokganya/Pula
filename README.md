Weather app that shows weather based on the location you select and as well as weather forecast.

API_KEY: Ask the developer for an OpenWeatherMap API_KEY to avoid publicly leaking it on GitHub. Or
create a free tier OpenWeatherMap api for OneCall 3.0 and Current Weather API, then insert it under
helper/GlobalConstant

Add a Google Maps API key in the local properties file as MAPS_API_KEY=API_KEY_HERE to allow google 
maps to function.
